It is designed to intelligently navigate websites to autonomously complete tasks like interacting with them or extracting data from them.</p> <p>For example, you can ask Sentius browser agent to find a quarterly financial results presentation of a public company:</p> <p>Our second AI agent is OpenAPI agent. It is designed to interact with a given web service's REST APIs as long as those APIs are described based on OpenAPI standard.</p> <p>For example, you can configure Sentius OpenAPI agent to ask a e-commerces shipping service like FreightOS to calculate shipping estimates for moving goods from China to US.</p> <p>Our third AI agent is Prompt Agent. It interacts with an LLM to perform tasks that do not require use of any tools, like providing a structured response to a question based on data obtained by other AI agents, or generating summaries etc.</p> <p>For example, you can ask Sentius prompt agent to look at the data collected by the browser agent and transform it into a form that is native for a given OpenAPI to be called by OpenAPI agent.</p> <p>There are more AI agents currently in development, like document agent capable of finding answers to a given question within a provided document or set of documents, desktop agent designed to control desktop applications across Windows and macOS, with even more coming in the future.</p> <p>You can learn more about our vision of Agentic Enterprise in our Whitepaper.</p> <p>To solve more complex tasks, agents can be combined together into multi-agent workflows using our Workflow Engine. </p> <p>Imagine that you want to make your organization more efficient using their power:</p> <ol> <li>You start with delegating small, individual tasks isolated from each other, to autonomous AI agents, like checking your customers' driver licenses on a DMV website of their driver license using our browser agent. </li> <li>As you start seeing the positive effect of having these tasks automated, you want to combine more and more such tasks delegated to various autonomous AI agents (browser agent, OpenAPI agent, prompt agent etc.) into multi-step workflows, to increase the level of automation. </li> <li>Over the time, you want to expand your workflows to more and more areas of work in your organization, but some tasks have to be done by people, and so you add people to the mix (human-in-the-loop). </li> <li>Finally, as you see your information work automated at the acceptable level for your company, you want to automate physical work, too, and so you delegate it to physical robots also powered by our AI agents combined together into multi-step workflows (coming in 2026+).</li> </ol>"},{"location":"#how-sentius-teach-repeat-platform-works","title":"How Sentius Teach &amp; Repeat Platform Works","text":"<p>At conceptual level, Sentius agentic platform starts with the autonomous AI agents that can work on their own, or be organized to work together within the agentic workflows using the agentic workflow engine.</p> <p>At user level, Sentius agentic platform starts with three Platform Components that make it easy to build autonomous agents and complex workflows - two applications and one service:</p>"},{"location":"#applications","title":"Applications","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Sentius Copilot+ - Electron-based desktop application that controls web browsers (and, later, desktop apps) across Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sentius Studio - native desktop application that allows creation, editing, testing, deployment, and monitoring of complex workflows.
